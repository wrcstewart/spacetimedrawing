Allows drawing points and lines Minowski spacetime diagram.
Two frames of reference in relative constant velocity motion
Flip between frames
3 regimes of motion - classical, relativistic and transitional

beginnings of gui for sections and chapters of book
the sections and chapters HAVE ONLY ONE or TWO entries (as proof of principle).
it is not a finished and populated teaching system

Can also dump SVG of diagrams.

I can no longer work on this project which was to be an intro book on SR with interactive diagrams.
I've diverted onto another project more urgent
Anyone that wants to further develop this code (which is rather dated) is welcome.
They are welcome to do whatever they want with it including selling their improved code / textbook.
The book was going to satrt with a discussion of symmetry - then invariance - Galilean / SR - experiments. A bit on GR
The software doesn't do GR ! That's where I got overambitous and my inuition not good enough. 
GR version would be amazing project for someone!!
A note on the code: it needs updating.
Despite being old it is fairly clear.
The only exception is section that detects whether two points are sufficiently close to toggle line drawing - that section a mess.
Good luck sorting it out
contact me for any help at wrcstewart@yahoo.co.uk
but i'm afraid I might have forgotten the logic of the code...

A note on the intended usage of the software in the book:
I was going to use spacetime diag of a light beam reflecting of a mirror in the two frames to show the 
tilt of the x axis
then noting the slope of the x axis matches the slope of the calibration curve where t axis intersects it this differential equation (easy to verify) defines a hyperbola - ie therefore Lorentz equations.
My original aim was to produce a graphic system that could render SR inuitive.
I believe with enough playing about the student could achieve this.
